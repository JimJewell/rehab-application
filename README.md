# RehabIT

## Description

RehabIT was developed to fill a need in the physical rehabilitation industry.  The application bridges a current gap between physical therapists and patients. Many sports medicine centers survey patients during each visit to understand the patient's progress toward restoring full functionality post injury/surgery.  Currently this process occurs with pen and paper, resulting in the therapist manually loading survey results to internal software without this data being shared back to the patient to display progress over time. RehabIT has been created to solve for this need.  RehabIT is a full stack React web application.  Technologies utilize include: Java, Spring Boot, React, JavaScript, A-Frame (VR), HTML, and CSS.
